## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Single-call firewall facade — `compact_tool_result()` /
  `firewalled_tool_result()` (#399).** Shrink one large tool result before it
  enters the prompt without standing up a `ContextManager`. Returns a
  `CompactResult` (`firewalled`, `payload`, `summary`, `facts`, `artifact_ref`,
  `stats`). Exported from the top level.
- **Structured (lossless) firewall mode (#406).** New `StructuredFirewall(keep=[...])`
  plus `summarize.structured.project` / `parse_path`: keep an allow-list of
  JSON paths inline, offload the rest to the artifact store (retrievable via
  `drilldown`), no LLM. Selectable through `compact_tool_result(strategy=...)`
  and `ContextManager.ingest_tool_result(..., firewall=StructuredFirewall(...))`.
- **First-class firewall diagnostics — `FirewallStats` (#402).** Records
  `triggered`, `strategy`, original/summary chars+tokens (`chars_saved` /
  `tokens_saved`), `artifact_ref`, and `summarized_by_llm`. Surfaced on
  `ResultEnvelope.firewall_stats`, and aggregated on `BuildStats.firewall_events`
  / `BuildStats.firewall_summary()`.
- **Determinism guarantee — `deterministic=True` (#404).** `ContextManager(deterministic=True)`
  and `compact_tool_result(deterministic=...)` *fail closed* with the new
  `DeterminismError` rather than passing data through an LLM-backed summariser;
  `FirewallStats.strategy` / `summarized_by_llm` make the path auditable.
- **Built-in token counter — `contextweaver.tokens` (#405).** Public
  `count()` / `get_token_counter()` / `heuristic_counter()` (and `TokenCounter`
  alias) so callers never wire `tiktoken` directly; firewall/`FirewallStats`
  numbers use the same counter. New no-op `contextweaver[tokenizers]` extra
  documents the contract (`tiktoken` is already core, with offline fallback).

### Changed

- **CI now exercises every committed generated-artifact drift check
  (#389–#393).** `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt`, recorded demo casts, and the
  gateway scorecard are gating checks on the Python 3.12 matrix cell; the
  deterministic smoke evaluation also runs there as a non-gating signal.

## [0.14.0] – 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Canonical Frame-shaped ingestion seam — `ContextManager.ingest_envelope()`
  (#352).** The execution boundary (e.g. agent-kernel) firewalls and hands
  contextweaver an already-firewalled `ResultEnvelope` (the native preimage of
  a weaver-spec `Frame`); contextweaver appends a summary-only `ContextItem`
  carrying the artifact handle and does **not** re-derive firewalling from raw
  output. The raw-output APIs (`ingest_tool_result`, `ingest_mcp_result`)
  remain for standalone use but are now labelled non-canonical for spec
  compliance. New [firewall boundary doc](docs/context_firewall_boundary.md)
  explains the contextweaver-firewall vs agent-kernel-firewall split and the
  seam; weaver-spec I-05 status updated accordingly.
- **Zero-Python config-file launch for the MCP gateway (#346).**
  `contextweaver mcp serve --config gateway.yaml` reads the catalog and serve
  options (`mode`, `top_k`, `beam_width`, `cache_stable`, `name`, `version`)
  from a single JSON/YAML file; explicit CLI flags still win. The catalog
  loader now also accepts the real-MCP-server snapshot shape
  (`{"tools": [...]}`) used by the recipes. New Cursor recipe
  (`docs/recipes/cursor.md`) plus `examples/recipes/gateway_config.yaml` and
  `examples/recipes/cursor_mcp.json`. (Bridging a *live* upstream MCP server
  over stdio remains follow-up on #346.)
- **`rank_collected` is now part of the public routing API (#288).** The
  score-sort / active-filter helper is re-exported from
  `contextweaver.routing` so custom `Navigator` implementations can reuse it.
- **End-to-end quality + cost benchmark vs a competent baseline (#345).** New
  `benchmarks/e2e_quality.py` runs realistic tool-using tasks three ways —
  naive concat, a hand-built competent baseline, and contextweaver — scoring
  tool-selection accuracy, hallucinated-tool rate, end-task answer accuracy,
  prompt tokens, and estimated cost per strategy. Ships with a deterministic
  stub model (default, exercised in CI) and an opt-in real-model path
  (`CW_E2E_LLM=1` + a user-supplied `call_fn`, no LLM SDK dependency). New
  `make e2e-quality` target (non-gating) and `benchmarks/e2e/tasks.json`
  fixtures. The published real-model headline is produced from a credentialed
  maintainer run.

### Changed

- **Decomposed `ContextManager` to meet the ≤300-line module guideline (#101).**
  The pipeline *logic* already lived in `context/build.py`
  (`run_build_pipeline`), `context/route_build.py`, `context/call_prompt.py`,
  and `context/ingest.py`; what remained was the manager's own method surface
  (`manager.py` was 878 lines of thin delegating stubs + docstrings). Those
  stubs now live in flat, single-level *partial-class* mixins —
  `_IngestMixin` (`context/_manager_ingest.py`), `_BuildMixin`
  (`context/_manager_build.py`), `_RoutingMixin` (`context/_manager_routing.py`)
  — sharing a `_ManagerState` base (`context/_manager_base.py`) that declares
  the private-attribute contract. `manager.py` is now **239 lines** (only
  `__init__`, properties, `drilldown`, and mixin composition); every module is
  ≤300. The delegate pipeline functions are now typed against `_ManagerState`
  (interface segregation; `ContextManager` inherits it via the mixins, so every
  call site is unchanged). No public API change — all 21 methods stay on
  `ContextManager` and the full test suite passes unmodified.
- **Unified routing metrics into `contextweaver.eval.metrics` (#354).**
  `benchmarks/benchmark.py` and `contextweaver.eval.routing` previously
  defined `recall@k` / `reciprocal_rank` under the same names with different
  semantics (fractional recall vs boolean hit-rate). They now share one
  canonical source of truth — `recall_at_k` (classic fractional recall),
  `precision_at_k`, `reciprocal_rank` — re-exported from `contextweaver.eval`.
  The benchmark scorecard numbers are unchanged; `evaluate_routing` now reports
  fractional recall for multi-expected cases (identical for the common
  single-expected case).
- **Split `extras/memory/zep.py` into `zep.py` + `_zep_common.py`** so each
  module stays within the repo's ≤300-lines-per-module rule (PR #360 review).
  The public import path (`contextweaver.extras.memory.zep`) and its exports
  (`ZepBackendError`, `ZepEpisodicStore`, `ZepFactStore`) are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Routing history tool-id resolution narrows its exception handling.**
  `route_build.resolve_tool_id_from_result` previously wrapped the parent
  event-log lookup in a bare `except Exception`, silently swallowing any error
  before falling back to `parent_id`. It now catches only `ItemNotFoundError`
  (the documented `EventLog.get` contract), so unexpected store errors surface
  instead of being hidden (PR #363 review).
- **Provider message encoders no longer emit empty-content messages.**
  `to_anthropic_messages` and `to_gemini_contents` now raise a clear
  `CatalogError` (with the offending `msg_index`) when a turn would
  serialise to empty or blank-text content, instead of letting the
  provider reject it later with an opaque
  `400 ... messages: ... must have non-empty content`. Messages that
  carry tool-use / tool-result / function-call blocks remain valid.
  OpenAI is intentionally left untouched: its Chat Completions API
  tolerates empty content and the empty-string assistant-content
  round-trip is an existing invariant (PR #230).
- **Zep backend defensively coerces scanned `tags` / `metadata`** when rebuilding
  `Episode` / `Fact` from persisted episodes: a non-list `tags` (e.g. a bare
  string, which previously iterated into characters) yields `[]`, and a non-dict
  `metadata` (which previously raised in `dict(...)`) yields `{}` (PR #360 review).
- **`LlmSummarizer` / `LlmExtractor` fallback warnings now include the underlying
  exception text**, so a degraded LLM path is diagnosable (timeout vs auth vs
  parsing) instead of opaque (PR #360 review).
